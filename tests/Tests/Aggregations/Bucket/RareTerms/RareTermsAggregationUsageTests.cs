/**
	 * A multi-bucket value source based aggregation which finds "rare" terms — terms that are at the long-tail of the
	 * distribution and are not frequent. Conceptually, this is like a terms aggregation that is sorted by _count ascending.
	 * As noted in the terms aggregation docs, actually ordering a terms agg by count ascending has unbounded error.
	 * Instead, you should use the rare_terms aggregation.
	 *
	 * See the OpenSearch documentation on {ref_current}/search-aggregations-bucket-rare-terms-aggregation.html[rare terms aggregation] for more detail.
