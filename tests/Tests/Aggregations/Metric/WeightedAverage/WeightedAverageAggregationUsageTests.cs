/**
	 * A single-value metrics aggregation that computes the weighted average of numeric values that are extracted
	 * from the aggregated documents. These values can be extracted either from specific numeric fields in the documents.
	 * When calculating a regular average, each datapoint has an equal "weight" i.e. it contributes equally to the final
	 * value. Weighted averages, on the other hand, weight each datapoint differently. The amount that each
	 * datapoint contributes to the final value is extracted from the document, or provided by a script.
	 *
	 * Be sure to read the OpenSearch documentation on {ref_current}/search-aggregations-metrics-weight-avg-aggregation.html[Weighted Avg Aggregation]
