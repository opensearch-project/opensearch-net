/**
	 * The rank_feature query is a specialized query that only works on `rank_feature` fields and `rank_features` fields.
	 * Its goal is to boost the score of documents based on the values of numeric features. It is typically put in a should clause of a bool query
	 * so that its score is added to the score of the query.
	 *
 * Compared to using `function_score` or other ways to modify the score, this query has the benefit of being able to efficiently
	 * skip non-competitive hits when track_total_hits is not set to true. Speedups may be spectacular.
	 *
	 * See the OpenSearch documentation on {ref_current}/query-dsl-rank-feature-query.html[rank feature query] for more details.
