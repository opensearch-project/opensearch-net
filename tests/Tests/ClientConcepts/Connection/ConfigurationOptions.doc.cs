		 * Connecting to OpenSearch with <<opensearch-net-getting-started,OpenSearch.Net>> and <<osc-getting-started,OSC>> is easy, but
		 * it's entirely possible that you'd like to change the default connection behaviour. There are a number of configuration options available
		 * on `ConnectionConfiguration` for the low level client and `ConnectionSettings` for the high level client that can be used to control
		 * how the clients interact with OpenSearch.
		 *
		 * ==== Options on ConnectionConfiguration
		 *
		 * The following is a list of available connection configuration options on `ConnectionConfiguration`; since
		 * `ConnectionSettings` derives from `ConnectionConfiguration`, these options are available for both
		 * the low level and high level client:
		 *
		 * :xml-docs: OpenSearch.Net:ConnectionConfiguration`1
