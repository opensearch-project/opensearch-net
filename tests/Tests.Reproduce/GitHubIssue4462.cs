/*
	 * https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/pull/4353
	 * Fixed an issue with the GetMany helpers that returned the cartesian product of all ids specified rather
	 * then creating a distinct list if more then one index was targeted.
	 *
	 * This PR also updated the routine in the serializer to omit the index name from each item if the index is
	 * already specified on the url in case of multiple indices
	 *
	 * This updated routine could throw if you are calling:
	 *
	 * client.GetMany<T>(ids, "indexName");
	 *
	 * Without configuring `ConnectionSettings()` with either a default index for T or a global default index.
